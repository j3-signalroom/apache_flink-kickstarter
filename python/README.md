# Flink Applications Powered by Python
Discover how Apache FlinkÂ® can transform your data pipelines! Explore hands-on examples of Flink applications using the [DataStream API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/dev/python/datastream/intro_to_datastream_api/), [Table API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/dev/python/table/intro_to_table_api/), and [Flink SQL](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/dev/table/sql/overview/#sql)â€”all built in Python with PyFlink, which compiles these apps to Java. You'll see how these technologies integrate seamlessly with AWS, GitHub, Terraform, and Apache Iceberg.

## 1.0 Important Note(s)
> As previously mentioned, PyFlink does not have a built-in Python-based data generator source for creating data streams. Therefore, before executing any of the Flink applications, it is necessary to pre-populate the Kafka topics `airline.skyone` and `airline.sunset` with data. To achieve this, run the Java-based Flink application named [`DataGeneratorApp`](../java/README.md) first, which is designed to generate sample records and populate these Kafka topics with the necessary data. This step ensures that subsequent Flink applications have data to work with and can properly perform their intended operations.

## 2.0 Power up the Apache Flink Docker containers

> **Prerequisite**
> 
> Before you can run `scripts/run-flink-locally.sh` Bash script, you need to install the [`aws2-wrap`](https://pypi.org/project/aws2-wrap/#description) utility.  If you have a Mac machine, run this command from your Terminal:
> ````bash
> brew install aws2-wrap
> ````
>
> If you do not, make sure you have Python3.x installed on your machine, and run this command from your Terminal:
> ```bash
> pip install aws2-wrap
> ```

This section guides you through the local setup (on one machine but in separate containers) of the Apache Flink cluster in Session mode using Docker containers with support for Apache Iceberg.  Run the `bash` script below to start the Apache Flink cluster in Session Mode on your machine:

```bash
scripts/run-flink-locally.sh on --profile=<AWS_SSO_PROFILE_NAME>
                                --chip=<amd64 | arm64>
                                --flink-language=python
                                [--aws-s3-bucket=<AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME>]
```
> Argument placeholder|Replace with
> -|-
> `<ACTIVATE_DOCKER_CONTAINER>`|`on` to turn on Flink locally, otherwise `off` to turn Flink off.
> `<AWS_SSO_PROFILE_NAME>`|your AWS SSO profile name for your AWS infrastructue that host your AWS Secrets Manager.
> `<CHIP>`|if you are running on a Mac with M1, M2, or M3 chip, use `arm64`.  Otherwise, use `amd64`.
> `<FLINK_LANGUAGE>`|`python` to specify Python is the language base of the Flink Apps you plan on running.  Otherwise, specifiy `java` if the language base of the Flink Apps are Java.
> `<AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME>`|**[Optional]** can specify the name of the AWS S3 bucket used to store Apache Iceberg files.

## 3.0 Discover What You Can Do with These Flink Apps
To access the JobManager (`apache_flink-kickstarter-jobmanager-1`) container, open the interactive shell by running:
```bash
docker exec -it -w /opt/flink/python_apps apache_flink-kickstarter-jobmanager-1 /bin/bash
```

Jump right into the container and take charge! Youâ€™ll have full control to run commands, explore the file system, and tackle any tasks you need. Youâ€™ll land directly in the `/opt/flink/python_apps` directoryâ€”this is the headquarters for all the Python scripts in the repo.

Ready to launch one of those cool Java-to-Python Flink apps? Just use the [`flink run`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/cli/) command with the correct options, and kick off the Python Flink app script with its corresponding parameters below. Adventure awaits!

Flink App|Flink Run Command
-|-
**`FlightImporterApp`**|`flink run --pyFiles kickstarter/python_files.zip --python kickstarter/flight_importer_app.py --aws-s3-bucket <AWS_S3_BUCKET> --aws-region <AWS_REGION_NAME>`
**`FlyerStatsApp`**|`flink run --pyFiles kickstarter/python_files.zip --python kickstarter/flyer_stats_app.py --aws-s3-bucket <AWS_S3_BUCKET> --aws-region <AWS_REGION_NAME>`

> Argument placeholder|Replace with
> -|-
> `<AWS_S3_BUCKET>`|specify name of the AWS S3 bucket you chosen during the Terraform creation or created yourself separately.  The AWS S3 bucket is used to store the Apache Iceberg files (i.e., data files, manifest files, manifest list file, and metadata files).
> `<AWS_REGION_NAME>`|specify the AWS Region your AWS Glue infrastructure resides.

## 4.0 Unleash Flink for Data Visualization
The exciting part is that after running all your Flink applications, the data now flows seamlessly into your Kafka Topics and Apache Iceberg Tables. But data alone doesnâ€™t tell the storyâ€”itâ€™s time to share those insights with the world! One fantastic way to do that is with Streamlit, which allows you to easily create interactive visualizations. Streamlit is intuitive, powerful, and designed with Python developers in mind, making it a breeze to turn raw data into captivating dashboards. ðŸ˜‰

![iceberg-flink-streamlit-drawing](../.blog/images/iceberg-flink-streamlit-drawing.png)

To illustrate, I created another Flink app that queries the `apache_kickstarter.airlines.flight` and `apache_kickstarter.airlines.flyer_stats` Apache Iceberg Tables, respectively, harnessing Flink SQL to extract valuable insights. These insights are then brought to life through a Streamlit dashboard, transforming raw data into an accessible, visual experience.

Here you go, run this in the docker container terminal command line:

```bash
streamlit run kickstarter/flink_kickstarter_visualization.py -- --aws-s3-bucket <AWS_S3_BUCKET> --aws-region <AWS_REGION_NAME>
```
> _Notice the extra `--` between streamlit run `kickstarter/flink_kickstarter_visualization.py` and the actual Flink App script arguments.  This is necessary to pass arguments to the Streamlit script without causing conflicts with Streamlit's own CLI options._
