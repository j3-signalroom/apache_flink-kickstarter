# Flink Apps written in Java
Examples of Apache FlinkÂ® applications showcasing the [DataStream API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/learn-flink/datastream_api/) and [Table API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/overview/) in Java, featuring AWS, GitHub, Terraform, and Apache Iceberg.  What's the difference between the DataStream API and Table API?  Click [how](../.blog/datastream-vs-table-api.md) to learn the differences. 

## Try out these Flink Apps
Before we start, I wanted to mention that in the project, I used ![gradle](../.blog/images/gradle-logo.png)[Gradle](https://gradle.com/) instead of Maven for the build automation.  Gradle is more straightforward, flexible, and powerful than its counterpart, Maven.  For instance, I use the Kotlin-supported version of Gradle to write the build because Kotlin offers type safety, IDE support, modern language features (i.e., not an XML derivative you'll find with Maven), and faster builds.

Okay, let's start by opening the project from the `Java` subfolder. Then run:

```bash
./gradlew app:clean
```

> *This command ensures a pristine build environment.  By removing previous build artifacts, this command guarantees that developers initiate their projects from a clean slate, minimizing inconsistencies and fostering a more reliable build process.*


Now build JAR file that contains all the Flink Apps on it, by running:

```bash
./gradlew app:build
```

Logon to the `apache_flink-kickstarter-jobmanager-1` container's Interative Shell:

```bash
docker exec -it -w /opt/flink/apps apache_flink-kickstarter-jobmanager-1 /bin/bash
```

> *This allows you to interact with the container as if you were inside its terminal, enabling you to run commands, inspect the file system, or perform other tasks interactively within the container.*

Finally, to run any of the Flink Apps, choose the app and then enter the corresponding CLI command from the table below:

App|Commands for CLI
-|-
**`DataGeneratorApp`**|`flink run --class apache_flink.kickstarter.DataGeneratorApp apache_flink-kickstarter-x.xx.xx.xxx.jar --get-from-aws`
**`FlightImporterApp`**|`flink run --class apache_flink.kickstarter.FlightImporterApp apache_flink-kickstarter-x.xx.xx.xxx.jar --get-from-aws`
**`UserStatisticsApp`**|`flink run --class apache_flink.kickstarter.UserStatisticsApp apache_flink-kickstarter-x.xx.xx.xxx.jar --get-from-aws`
